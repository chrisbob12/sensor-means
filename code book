The file dataOut.txt is provided as a summary of data held by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The parent dataset is held here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The dataset dataOut.txt is a subset of the variables labelled as mean() and std() from the parent dataset. It is assumed that these are summaries from multipoint data streams generated for each observation in the experiment, whereas other text occurences of 'Mean' are not derived in this way. The parent dataset contains multiple values within each group of activity per subject.

The dataset dataOut.txt contains the mean value for each set of observations grouped by subject (column 1) and activity (column 2)

Due to time constraints it has not been possible to make the list narrower, but anomalies in the original text (such as duplication of words) have been removed, and the strings have been separated from the original camel to improve intelligibility and ease further processing.

It is clear that there are other variable groups embedded in the variable names, which would benefit from being broken out into different observations. Specifically:
Time Domain: realtime and FFT
Sensor: accelerometer and gyroscope
Acceleration source: body and gravity
Axis: X, Y, Z and all


The 68 variables in dataOut are as follows:
