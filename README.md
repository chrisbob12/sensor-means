============

course project for Coursera 'getting and cleaning data'

The file run-analysis.R is sufficiently commented to show how it works.

## read contents of datafiles into dataframes
## join testing and training dataframes
## remove interim components
## clean up feature names from features.txt
## add features as column names
## maybe remove xData 
## add activity descriptions to numbers and descriptive variable names
## convert subject numbers to factors and add to dataset
## remove redundant activity code column
## calculate means grouped by subject and activity
